This website hosts the results of VIBE, the Vector Index Benchmark for Embeddings.
You can use its interactive plots to explore the results of the benchmark.
In particular, head over to

- the [overview](/overview.html) page to compare all the algorithms across all datasets at a glance
- the [datasets](/datasets.html) page for detailed information about all the datasets we consider
- the [tradeoffs](/tradeoff.html) page to explore the tradeoff between recall
  and query throughput of different index data structures
- the [algorithm focus](/algorithm_focus.html) page to see the performance of
  _all_ the configurations we tested for each algorithm.
